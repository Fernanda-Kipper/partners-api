# Partners API

This project is an API built using **Java, Java Spring, Flyway Migrations, PostgresSQL as the database, and Spring Security for authentication control.** 

The API simulates the functionality of a food delivery platform like [iFood](https://www.ifood.com.br/) and [ZÃ© Delivery](https://www.ze.delivery/). Users can register themselves into the app, and logged-in users can search for nearby restaurant partners, while ADMIN users can register new partners in the API.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/project-name.git
```

2. Install dependencies with Maven

3. Install [PostgresSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)
4. Install  [Postgis Extension](https://postgis.net/documentation/getting_started/)

## Usage

1. Start the application with Maven
2. The API will be accessible at http://localhost:8080


## API Endpoints
The API provides the following endpoints:

```markdown
GET /partners - Retrieve a list of all partners.

GET /partners/{partnerId} - Retrieve a specific partner by ID.

POST /partners - Register a new partner (ADMIN access required).

GET /partners/search - Search for partners near a specified location.

POST /auth/login - Login into the App

POST /auth/register - Register a new user into the App
```

## Authentication
The API uses Spring Security for authentication control. The following roles are available:

```
ROLE_USER - Standard user role for logged-in users.
ROLE_ADMIN - Admin role for managing partners (registering new partners).
```
To access protected endpoints as an ADMIN user, provide the appropriate authentication credentials in the request header.

## Database
The project utilizes [PostgresSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) as the database. The necessary database migrations are managed using Flyway.

Also, this project is using the PostgresSQL extension [Postgis](https://postgis.net/) to store coordinates in [GeoJson](https://geojson.org/) pattern.
