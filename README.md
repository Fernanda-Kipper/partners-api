# Partners API

This project is an API built using **Java, Java Spring, Flyway Migrations, PostgresSQL as the database, and Spring Security for authentication control.** 

The API simulates the functionality of a food delivery platform like [iFood](https://www.ifood.com.br/) and [ZÃ© Delivery](https://www.ze.delivery/). Users can registrate themselves into the app, and logged-in users can search for nearby restaurant partners, while ADMIN users can register new partners in the API.
